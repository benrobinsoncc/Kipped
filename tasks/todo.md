# Positivity Tracker Transformation Plan

## Overview
Transform Kipped from a todo app into a daily positivity tracker where users write positive experiences each day, view progress through year/month/list views, and get daily notifications to encourage reflection.

## Current State Analysis
- **Data Model**: Todo-based with title, completion, archiving, reminders
- **UI**: List-based interface with create/edit functionality
- **Features**: Theming, notifications, settings customization
- **Architecture**: SwiftUI + ViewModel pattern with UserDefaults persistence

## Transformation Tasks

### Phase 1: Data Model & Core Logic
- [ ] **Create PositiveNote data model** - Replace Todo with date-focused positive note structure
- [ ] **Update ViewModel for positivity tracking** - Transform TodoViewModel to PositiveNoteViewModel
- [ ] **Implement date-based organization** - Group notes by day/month/year for calendar views
- [ ] **Add daily notification system** - Replace task reminders with daily positivity prompts

### Phase 2: View Architecture & Navigation
- [ ] **Create ViewMode enum** - Define List, Month, Year view states
- [ ] **Implement HomePage with view switching** - Main container managing different view modes
- [ ] **Build ListView component** - Show chronological list of positive notes with dates
- [ ] **Create MonthView grid** - Calendar-style month view with completion indicators
- [ ] **Build YearView with 365 dots** - Full-screen dot grid showing yearly progress

### Phase 3: Gesture & Interaction System
- [ ] **Add pinch-to-zoom navigation** - Smooth transitions between year/month/list views
- [ ] **Implement view state management** - Handle smooth transitions and zoom levels
- [ ] **Add tap interactions** - Navigate to specific days/months from overview views
- [ ] **Update note creation flow** - Date-focused positive note entry

### Phase 4: Visual Progress & Polish
- [ ] **Design progress indicators** - Checkmarks/icons for days with positive notes
- [ ] **Add smooth view transitions** - Animated zoom between different time scales
- [ ] **Update empty states** - Encourage daily positive reflection
- [ ] **Refine notification content** - Crafted daily positivity prompts

### Phase 5: Final Integration & Testing
- [ ] **Update app branding** - Rename from todo focus to positivity focus
- [ ] **Integrate with existing theming** - Maintain current customization features
- [ ] **Test notification system** - Ensure daily prompts work correctly
- [ ] **Polish animations and UX** - Smooth, delightful user experience

## Technical Approach
- **Keep Simple**: Each change impacts minimal code, following simplicity principle
- **Preserve Assets**: Maintain existing theming, colors, fonts, app icons
- **Gradual Transformation**: Build new alongside old, then replace
- **Data Migration**: Convert existing todos to positive notes if any exist

## Key Design Decisions
1. **365 Dot Layout**: Full-screen grid showing entire year at glance
2. **Single Daily Note**: One positive note per day to encourage focused reflection
3. **Smooth Zoom**: Pinch gesture transitions feeling natural and responsive
4. **Minimal Visual**: Clean dots with simple completion indicators (checkmark icon)
5. **Daily Prompts**: Thoughtful notification messages encouraging positivity

## Future Features (Post-MVP)
- AI-powered summaries of positive trends
- Sharing capabilities for accountability
- Weekly/monthly positivity statistics
- Export functionality for data portability
- Multiple notes per day option
- Rich text formatting for notes
