### Changes Made

#### 1. Font Selection Dark Mode Support (ContentView.swift:1144-1180)
- Added `@Environment(\.colorScheme) var colorScheme` to `SkeuomorphicFontButton`
- Created `buttonGradient` computed property that provides different gradients for light/dark mode
- Dark mode uses darker gray tones (0.25 to 0.10 range) instead of light grays
- Light mode maintains original appearance

#### 2. App Icon Selection Spacing (ContentView.swift:938)
- Reduced `LazyVGrid` spacing in `AppIconSelectionOverlay` from 20 to 12
- Creates tighter visual grouping of app icon options

#### 3. Accent Color Selection Spacing (ContentView.swift:895)
- Reduced `LazyVGrid` spacing in `AccentColorPickerOverlay` from 16 to 12
- Creates more compact layout for color selection

#### 4. Black Theme Color Fix (ContentView.swift:732)
- Changed dark theme color from `Color(red: 0.03, green: 0.03, blue: 0.03)` to `Color.black`
- Eliminates blue tint in dark theme selection button

#### 5. Bold Font Weight Enhancement (KippedApp.swift:37,48)
- Updated `FontOption.bold` from `.bold` to `.heavy` weight
- Applied to both `font` and `uiFont` properties for consistency
- Makes bold text significantly more prominent in font picker
